Pratt Institute Libraries emphatically declare our opposition to the racial terror and systemic injustices that shape the lives of Black people in the United States. Black lives matter. We share the sorrow and outrage of our community and are in solidarity with protests against racism and police brutality. We grieve the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and the countless other Black Americans who have lost their lives to racist and police-inflicted violence. We affirm our commitment to anti-racist practice and pledge to use our skills and resources to advance the production of and access to information for social and racial justice.

It is in this spirit that the Libraries have compiled this list of currently available anti-racist resources. We hope these resources will encourage the entire Pratt Institute community to understand racism more deeply so we can pull it up by the roots.
