Pratt Institute Libraries condemns the recent racist, hate-fueled attacks on Asian, Asian American and Asian/Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities. Anti-Asian bias is not new in this country and we cannot let this go without notice. We must open our eyes to how recent events and past history directly impacts our Pratt community. As an institution with a significant number of international students, many from Asian countries, we stand in solidarity with them and all our community members of Asian descent. We are committed to creating a more equitable society that truly values and embraces perspectives from diverse cultures. We pledge to use our resources and skills to build and provide access to collections and services that honor the history of AAPI communities and support our affected students at this difficult time.

The Libraries have created this guide featuring links to Library resources for members of the Pratt community to learn more about how to address the current moment and educate themselves about Asian American and Pacific Islander culture and history.
