Barbara Levy, Pratt Institute Department of Art Therapy program graduate class of 1990,
donated her thesis research and archive to Pratt Institute Libraries in 2019. Levy engages with
nature by studying dolphins to ascertain whether they have the motor skills needed to manipulate
paint. Her thesis centered on art therapy, and she conducted a study of the painting activity of
four Atlantic Bottlenose dolphins at the Dolphin Research Center in Marathon Shores, Florida.
This study was used to see whether dolphins and human children developed creative activity in
similar ways. Levy has worked in art therapy and counseling, and has also run her own art
gallery.

By exhibiting Barbara Levy&#39;s drawings, the dolphin paintings, and videos we hope to share her
view of cross-species communication and aesthetics. Levy analyzed the dolphins&#39; artwork using
theories of child art development and Laban Movement Analysis.
The playful aspect of dolphin behavior, and their interactions with Levy suggest the important
connection with these theories of behavior and development. The dolphins&#39; artwork shows how
their cross-species communication engages a deeper relationship with humans. Human
relationships with other species are a source of constant and continued relevance for all of us.
The exhibition contains materials drawn from the Pratt Institute Libraries' Special Collections and
Archives. The Curatorial team would like to thank Barbara Levy, the Library Event &amp; Archives
staff, and Lisa A. Banner.
