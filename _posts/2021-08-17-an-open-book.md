**The Libraries are Back!** After providing services to the Pratt Community largely online for almost a year and a half, the Libraries enthusiastically celebrate the reopening of the facilities to the community with an exhibition featuring a selection of its most surprising and exciting collections.

Curated and organized by staff and student employees across the Libraries and encompassing both the Brooklyn and Manhattan campuses, the exhibition sheds particular light on Special Collections and Archives: 16mm films and projection equipment; zines and artists’ books; archival materials and photographs focusing on the history of the Libraries; fine press editions; bookplates, early printed books and incunabula; pop-up books and children’s books; and collaborations with Franklin Furnace.

**On view August 23rd - October 6th, 2021**<br>
Brooklyn Campus Library, floors 1-3<br>
Pratt Manhattan Campus, floor 4
