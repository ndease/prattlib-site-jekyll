Art of the Book might make you rethink what a book can be. It features the work of Pratt student and alumni creators from undergraduate and graduate disciplines in Architecture, Art and Design Education, Fine Arts, Painting, Drawing, Communications Design, Illustration, Fashion, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Interior Design, and Writing. Book structures range from traditional forms with accordion and stab bindings to more experimental designs with materials like an entire pair of blue jeans, jump rings (chains), lanternflies, cassette tapes, and trash.
