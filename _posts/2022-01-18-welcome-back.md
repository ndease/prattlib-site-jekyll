Welcome back! The Pratt Institute Libraries are happy to announce updates to library services for Spring 2022. The libraries will be open on a reduced schedule as well as provide online research help, and PDF scanning.


## Visiting the Libraries
This Spring, The Libraries will remain open on a reduced schedule. [See hours](https://pratt.libcal.com/hours). Community members will be able to freely browse the Libraries’ circulating collections in the stacks and reading rooms. Pick up requests are not required, but they continue to be an option for those that prefer not to browse the stacks. For more information about browsing the stacks, visit our [Finding Books guide](https://libguides.pratt.edu/finding-books).

## Research Help
Get research help online via chat, email, and by appointment. Look for the “Ask a Librarian” pop up chat on the bottom right of our website for instant research help. [Research guides](https://libguides.pratt.edu/?b=s) are available to help you get started with your projects. [Video tutorials](https://talks.pratt.edu/category/Libraries%3ELibrary+Tutorials/122554662) are available to walk you through core library resources and research practices. Subject specialist librarians are available for [one-on-one meetings over Zoom](https://pratt.libcal.com/appointments?lid=2583&g=5064).

## Special Collections
Special Collections materials will be available by request from the reference desk on the first floor of the Brooklyn Library, Monday through Friday from 9:00AM to 5:00PM. You may request three books at a time. Appointments are needed to view more than three items or the oversized items in the collection. For more information about access to [Special Collections](https://libguides.pratt.edu/specialcollections) and to inquire about an appointment, please contact [speccoll.library@pratt.edu](mailto:speccoll.library@pratt.edu).

Scanning requests can be made by clicking on the "Request a PDF Scan" button in [our catalog](https://cat.pratt.edu). For more information about the Request a PDF service and copyright compliance policies, see [Scanning Services](https://libguides.pratt.edu/scanning).
