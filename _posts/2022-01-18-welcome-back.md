Welcome back! The Pratt Institute Libraries are happy to announce updates to library services for Spring 2022.


## Visiting the Libraries
This Spring, The Libraries will remain open on a reduced schedule. [See hours](https://pratt.libcal.com/hours). Community members will be able to freely browse the Libraries’ circulating collections in the stacks and reading rooms. Pick up requests are not required, but they continue to be an option for those that prefer not to browse the stacks. For more information about browsing the stacks, visit our [Finding Books guide](https://libguides.pratt.edu/finding-books).

## Research Help
Get research help online via chat, email, and by appointment. Look for the “Ask a Librarian” pop up chat on the bottom right of our website for instant research help. [Research guides](https://libguides.pratt.edu/?b=s) are available to help you get started with your projects. [Video tutorials](https://talks.pratt.edu/category/Libraries%3ELibrary+Tutorials/122554662) are available to walk you through core library resources and research practices. Subject specialist librarians are available for [one-on-one meetings over Zoom](https://pratt.libcal.com/appointments?lid=2583&g=5064).

## PDF scanning
Scanning requests can be made by clicking on the "Request a PDF Scan" button in [our catalog](https://cat.pratt.edu). For more information about the Request a PDF service and copyright compliance policies, see [Scanning Services](https://libguides.pratt.edu/scanning).
