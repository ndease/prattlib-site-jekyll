The Pratt Institute Libraries have made your research process easier! We've revamped our library search system to provide enhanced support for Pratt OneKey Single Sign On. With this new update, you will no longer need to create a separate [EBSCOhost account](https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/How-to-Create-and-Manage-a-My-EBSCOhost-Account?language=en_US) to access special library features like saving books/articles to folders, checking out eBooks, or saving/sharing your search results.  

From now on, you will be prompted to log in with your Pratt OneKey when you enter keywords into the search bar on our homepage. Once authenticated, you will be prompted to accept the [EBSCO Privacy Policy](https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/Why-am-I-prompted-to-review-EBSCOs-privacy-policy-before-creating-a-personal-My-EBSCOhost-account?language=en_US) . Please note that you do not need to accept the terms in order to access full-text resources, but you do need to accept the terms if you want to use special features such as folders, accessing eBooks, or saving/sharing search results. Furthermore, you can withdraw consent to data retention at any time, which will delete any previously retained data and account information from EBSCOâ€™s Discovery platform (our library search system). If you already have an EBSCOhost account with saved items registered via a non-pratt email address, you can merge your accounts by going to Update My Account at the top navigation bar. [See How to Merge Personal User Accounts](https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/How-to-Merge-PUA-Accounts?language=en_US) for more information.

If you have any questions or concerns about this update, please contact us at [systems.library@pratt.edu](mailto:systems.library@pratt.edu).
