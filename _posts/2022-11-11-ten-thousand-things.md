When Ron Anderson and David Rees launched [Ten Thousand Things](https://www.tenthousandthingsnyc.com/) 30-years ago they captured the zeitgeist of the moment in their ground-breaking minimalist jewels. The capsule retrospective exhibition highlights media moments, the celebrities who became fans and treasures made by the self-taught design duo on the bench.

Exhibit on View: November 15 - December 15, Pratt Institute Library, Floor 3, Brooklyn Campus.

This retrospective will include a visual presentation of pieces from 1991 until now with emphasis on editorial highlights over the past 30 years, important collaborations including Sothebys and The MET and some explanation of the various retail flagship spaces the duo have created.

Marion Fasel, The Adventurine founder, will moderate a discussion on November 15 at 6 PM at the Pratt Institute Library in the Alumni Reading Room, 3rd Floor, Brooklyn Campus.
