In conjunction with the [Pratt Anti-Racism Symposium](https://sites.google.com/pratt.edu/prattanti-racismsymposium/schedule?authuser=0&pli=1), the Libraries are partnering with [Black Lunch Table](https://www.blacklunchtable.com/wiki/) to hold a Wikipedia edit-a-thon. The purpose of this edit-a-thon is two-fold: to improve Wikipedia by adding citations and information to Wikipedia entries on Black artists, designers, writers, performers, and architects as well as diversify who edits Wikipedia by including more women and bipoc editors to the mix (a commonly cited stat is that 71% of wikipedia editors are white and 91% are men). Librarians and Wikimedians from Black Lunch Table and Wikimedia NYC will be on hand to help students create Wikipedia accounts, do some research, and start editing!

The edit-a-thon will take place 2/24 from 12-4 in the Learning Lab at the Brooklyn Campus Library (lower level).
