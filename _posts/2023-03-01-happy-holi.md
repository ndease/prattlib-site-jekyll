Happy Holi! This event will take place on March 8th at Pratt Manhattan Campus 7th floor between 4 PM and 6 PM. Join us in celebration of Holi, a festival of color. Holi is a celebration full of fun and happiness. Holi celebrates love, fertility, and harvest.  

“Because everyone is covered in color, ethnicity, class, age, and gender are ignored and everyone is supposed to be seen as equal.” Just another reminder for all of us.
