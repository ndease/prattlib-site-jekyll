            <p>The mission of the Pratt Institute Libraries is to provide outstanding service and access to a resource-rich environment that facilitates critical thinking and creative teaching and learning in the Pratt community.</p>
            <p> Pratt's Brooklyn Campus Library is located in the neighborhood of Clinton Hill, in a handsome 1896 landmark building with interiors by the Tiffany Glass & Decorating Company. Collections and services are focused on the visual arts, architecture,
                design, creative writing, and allied fields. Additional materials of general interest support the general education curriculum. The library houses more than 200,000 volumes of print materials, including 600+ periodicals, rare books,
                and the college archives.</p>

            <p> The Pratt Manhattan Center (PMC) Library is located in historic Greenwich Village bordering the gallery district of Chelsea. The library offers a growing collection of monographs, serials, and a wide range of electronic resources.</p>
            <p>The Pratt Institute Libraries support the Pratt community as well as visiting researchers by appointment. </p>
