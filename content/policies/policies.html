                              <p>The faculty and staff of Pratt Institute Libraries believe that Open Access to scholarship is critical for scholarly communication, the future of libraries more generally and advancing the  library’s mission of providing outstanding service and access to a resource-rich environment that facilitates critical thinking, and creative teaching and learning in the Pratt community. The Libraries pledge to support and promote open access scholarship, resources, and services. In supporting the spread of knowledge outside of strict paywalls of traditional scholarly publishing structures, the Libraries commit to collecting robust Open Access resources as described in the <a href="https://libguides.pratt.edu/c.php?g=1057089&p=7752915">Electronic Resources Evaluation Policy</a> and <a href="https://libguides.pratt.edu/cd_policy">Collection Development Policy.</a> By promoting resources that are free and open access, the Libraries' further their commitment to advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility, as these resources will continue to be accessible to students after graduation, as well as being decoupled from traditional academic silos.</p>
                              <p>This pledge builds upon the Libraries’ practices/programs centering <a href="https://www.jstor.org/site/pratt/">access to digital and digitized scholarly resources</a> and services such as the collection of Pratt community records in its <a href="https://libguides.pratt.edu/c.php?g=943958&p=8012973">Archives</a>, promotion of open educational resources, <a href="https://libguides.pratt.edu/thesiscollection">collection of theses and dissertations</a> and future development of an institutional repository.</p>

                              <p>In keeping with the Pratt Institute’s aim <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/the-institute/diversity-and-inclusion/">“to be a campus that welcomes and encourages individuals of all backgrounds,”</a> the Pratt Institute Libraries seeks to address records in the <a href="https://cat.pratt.edu/">library catalog</a> that are historically inaccurate, offensive, discriminatory, or otherwise harmful. The Pratt Institute Libraries follow the standard practice of using controlled standard  vocabularies, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Subject_Headings">Library of Congress Subject Headings</a> (LCSH) which are similar to hashtags and keywords, making it possible for users to retrieve more precise results. Using controlled vocabularies and subject headings helps organize information and enhances cross-platform searching and information retrieval within the Libraries’ catalog, discovery layer, and databases. While this uniformity allows users to capture a concept and find similar information more efficiently by creating linkages between records, this efficiency may come at a cost when some of the problematic language found in the catalog stems from using such controlled standard vocabularies.</p>

                          <p><b>For this reason the Pratt Institute Libraries are taking the following steps to address offensive language and content in its catalogs and databases:</b></p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Systematically revise and update collection descriptions.</li>
                            <li>Update author records in existing records with a “dead name” (the birth name of a transgender person who has changed their name as part of their gender transition.)</li>
                            <li>The Pratt Institute Libraries supports initiatives to remove bias and promote inclusion in the catalog by replacing outdated and/or <a href="https://cataloginglab.org/problem-lcsh/">harmful LCSH subject headings</a> with more equitable local term options. Petitioning the Library of Congress’ Policy and Standards Division is a bureaucratic process that takes time, but we are actively participating in the process and advocating for change.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>The Pratt Institute Libraries encourage its users to participate in this process. If you encounter any perjorative language (i.e. racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic) or content in the Libraries’ catalog records, finding aids, or digitized collections, please fill out our <a href="https://pratt.libwizard.com/f/reportaproblem">Report a Problem Form</a>.
